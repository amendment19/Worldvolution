# Worldvolution
Information gathering app on social issues!
This app will present a home page with a dictionary-style list of social issue topics. Each topic in the list will be a button. Clicking the button for the topic takes the user to a content page for that topic. The content page will be populated from an API from a trusted source in that topic area. This way a user only has to have one app, The Worldvolution app, to access trusted information on a variety of social issues.
